    <p>This mushroom tacos recipe comes together in a flash: it should take you about 20 to 25 minutes to put together. The taco is a Mexican invention, likely from the Aztec times, and was first introduced in the US in 1905. We honor the great tradition of Mexican cuisine in this recipe! The only part that requires cooking is sautéing the portobello mushrooms with a few spices. Combine those with canned refried beans to add enough protein to keep these tacos filling.

    How to Make Tacos
    This mushroom tacos recipe is so simple to make and bursting with flavor! Here’s one note to keep in mind on serving size:

    The mushrooms shrink down in the pan. It looks like a lot at first, but as they cook off the water the mushrooms shrink in volume.
    Add just a handful of mushrooms per taco. It will still add massive flavor. Place them on a generous helping of refried beans.
    If you’re feeding very hungry eaters, make 1.5 times the mushrooms and double the beans. Or, you can accessorize with more hearty side dishes! See below.
    
    
    All you’ve got to do is sauté the mushrooms with spices, then make a quick slaw and top them with toppings. You don’t even need to make a sauce, though you can top with sour cream if you like. They’re juicy and delicious as is!
