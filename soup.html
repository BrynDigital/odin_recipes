    Several of our best vegan soups are hearty enough to be a full vegan dinner, thanks to a hefty portion of plant-based protein (think tofu, beans, lentils and grains). These soups take inspiration from around the world, using spices, herbs and surprising ingredients to pack plenty of flavor into every bowl.

Serve the soup with a simple vegan side, salad or a loaf of crusty bread.

    <h1> Step-By-Step</h1>
        Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</h3>
 </div>
 <div>
    <ol class="ol1">
<li>Potatoes</li>
<li>Celery </li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>All-purpose flour</li>
<li>Soy milk</li>
<li>Vegan butter-style sticks</li>
<li>Vegetable broth</li>

    </ol>
 </div>

 <h1>Ingredients</h1>
 <div>
    <ol class="ol2">
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 generous cup chopped onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the noodles</li>
        <li>1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 (10-ounce) boxes frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed in clean towel for excess moisture</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese (about 4 cups)</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers until you reach the top</li>
 </div>

 <div>
    <h1>GETTING STARTED</h1>
    <p>Heat the oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add in the onions and sauté for 3-4 minutes. Add in the celery and leek and continue cooking for another 3-5 minutes before adding in the mushrooms, garlic and thyme. Mix well and continue cooking for another 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>Add in the miso paste and mix until well incorporated. Add in the carrots and beans and then pour over the broth. Mix well, lower the heat to medium low, cover the pot and simmer for 25 minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Season with salt & pepper.</p>
 
 <p>Add in the cooked wild rice, fresh greens and turn off the heat. Once the greens have wilted from the residual heat, add in the cashew cream and mix well. Check for seasoning and any additional salt & pepper if needed.</p>

 <p>Add in the potatoes and mix well. Add in the flour and mix until everything is well coated. Cook the mixture for 2-3 minutes stirring occasionally.
</p>

<p>
    Add in the corn and broth and mix well. Add 2-3 cobs to the pot and cook covered for 20 minutes. Remove the lid and continue cooking for another 10 minutes or until the potatoe are fork tender.
