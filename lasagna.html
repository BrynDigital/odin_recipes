    Lasagna Ingredients
    The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:
    
    Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
    Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
    Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
    Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
    Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
    Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
    Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
    Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.

        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 generous cup chopped onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling the noodles</li>

        <li>2 (10-ounce) boxes frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed in clean towel for excess moisture</li>

    <h1>GETTING STARTED</h1>
    <p>Bring a pot of water to a boil.
        Set a pot of water over high heat and let it come to a boil while you start the sauce. When the sauce is ready to simmer, the pasta water should be boiling and ready to cook the lasagna noodles.</p>
        <p>Add the olive oil to the mushrooms and stir to coat. Sauté the mushrooms and onions for about a minute. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.

            Stir in the tomato paste, cook for a minute longer. Reserve 1 cup of the tomato sauce (it will go in the bottom of the casserole dish), and put the remaining cup of tomato sauce into the pot with the mushrooms. Add the large can of crushed tomatoes and one cup of water.
            
            Stir in the thyme, sugar, and red pepper flakes. (If you are using dried basil instead of fresh, add it now.) Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer on a low simmer, for 20</p>
 
 <p>Spread the one cup of reserved tomato sauce over the bottom of a large (preferably 10- x 15-inch) casserole dish. (If your casserole dish is smaller, you may need to add another layer as you go through this step.)</p>

 <p>Once the sauce is simmering, salt the boiling pasta water, and add the dry lasagna noodles to the boiling water. (The water should be at a vigorous, rolling boil.) Stir gently, making sure that the noodles are not sticking to each other. Set the timer for 8 minutes, or however long is indicated on the package of the noodles. Cook uncovered on a high boil.

    When the noodles are ready (al dente, cooked through but still firm to the bite), drain the noodles in a colander, and rinse them to cool them with cold water. As you rinse them, gently separate them with your fingers so they don't stick to each other.

</p>

<p>
    Repeat the layers:
Repeat the layering process. Place a second layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining ricotta, spinach, and mozzarella over the noodles. Sprinkle another quarter of the pecorino along with the mozzarella. Top with another third of the mushroom sauce and the remaining fresh basil.

Layer your final layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining sauce over the lasagna noodles, and sprinkle with the remaining pecorino or parmesan cheese.
